## Power BI Projects
### Personal Finance Analysis
[View report here](https://github.com/jdok8/powerbi-personal-finance)

This project facilitates in-depth analysis of family expenses by consolidating data from diverse sources, including CSV files from various bank accounts. Demonstrating advanced data visualization techniques within Power BI for educational purposes, the report showcases synthetic financial transactions. While the dataset contains multiple currencies, all values are uniformly presented in Danish Krone (DKK) in the visualizations unless explicitly stated otherwise. Offering insights into account balances, income, expenses, and investment trends over time, users gain comprehensive insights into their financial dynamics. The project consolidates data from CSV files representing transactions, ensuring seamless integration for ongoing analysis and optimization.

### Analysis of Terrorist Attacks Worldwide between 1970 and 2017
[View report here](https://github.com/jdok8/powerbi-global-terrorism)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
