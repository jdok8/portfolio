## Python Projects

### Sales Analysis: Evaluating Sales Strategies for Optimal Revenue
[View project here](https://github.com/jdok8/python-sales-analysis)

This project involves analyzing the effectiveness of different sales approaches (Email, Call, and Email + Call) using Python to optimize the company's strategy. By evaluating the number of customers, revenue distribution, and overall performance for each method, the project provides data-driven recommendations on the most effective sales approach to maximize revenue while minimizing time and resource investment.

- **Tools & Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Key Insights**:
  - The `Email + Call` method generated the highest average revenue per customer, despite requiring only 10 minutes per call.
  - The `Email` method had the broadest reach, making it the most efficient for mass outreach with minimal effort.
  - The `Call` method, although time-consuming, proved to be the least effective, generating the lowest revenue per unit sold.
  
This project showcases data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques, providing actionable insights based on customer sales data.


## Power BI Projects
### Personal Finance Analysis
[View report here](https://github.com/jdok8/powerbi-personal-finance)

This project facilitates in-depth analysis of family expenses by consolidating data from diverse sources, including CSV files from various bank accounts. Demonstrating advanced data visualization techniques within Power BI for educational purposes, the report showcases synthetic financial transactions. While the dataset contains multiple currencies, all values are uniformly presented in Danish Krone (DKK) in the visualizations unless explicitly stated otherwise. Offering insights into account balances, income, expenses, and investment trends over time, users gain comprehensive insights into their financial dynamics. The project consolidates data from CSV files representing transactions, ensuring seamless integration for ongoing analysis and optimization.
